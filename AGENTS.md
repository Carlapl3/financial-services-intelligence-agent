- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and maintainability over cleverness.

## Tooling
- Primary language: Python
- Build and environment details live in `docs/BUILD.md`.

## Plan Mode
When asked to plan:
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
- End each plan with a list of unresolved questions, if any.

## Further Guidance
- Architecture & Domain: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Coding Conventions: docs/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md
- Testing: docs/TESTING.md
