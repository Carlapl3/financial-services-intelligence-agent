# AI Trend Monitoring

> Demo repository showcasing the architecture and outputs of an AI-assisted, rule-based trend monitoring agent for financial services.

An AI-assisted, rule-based agent for financial and regulatory trend monitoring.

- Architecture overview: `docs/architecture.png`

## Overview

AI Trend Monitoring is a task-oriented, AI-assisted agent designed for recurring monitoring of financial and regulatory developments.

The system collects signals from selected sources, applies configurable rules and prioritization logic, uses LLMs for structured extraction and interpretation, and generates concise, executive-ready digests for decision-makers.

This repository is intentionally scoped as a **portfolio-grade demonstration** of system design, architecture, and reasoning.

---

## Usage (Conceptual)

**Input**
- Curated sources (RSS feeds, official publications, web pages)
- Rule-based configuration defining scope, exclusions, and priorities

**Output**
- A structured trend digest (Markdown / email-friendly format)

See example output in:  
`examples/sample-digest-v1.md`

---

## Capabilities

- Recurring collection of financial and regulatory signals
- Deduplication of overlapping or redundant items
- Rule-based filtering and prioritization
- LLM-assisted extraction:
  - Summary
  - Category
  - Impact level
  - “Why it matters”
- Ranking and formatting into consistent executive digests

---

## How It Works (High Level)

The system follows a deterministic, agent-based pipeline:
collect → dedupe → apply_rules → extract → rank → digest → output
A visual overview of the pipeline is available in `docs/architecture.png`.

## Repository Structure

- `examples/`: Sample outputs generated by the system (executive digests).
- `docs/`: High-level documentation describing architecture and pipeline flow.
- `src/`: Skeleton code illustrating the core pipeline stages.
- `templates/`: Templates for digest formats and configuration examples.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## What This Project Is / Is Not

### What This Project Is
- A **portfolio-grade demonstration** of AI-native system design
- An example of a **rule-based, task-oriented AI agent**
- Focused on **clarity, structure, and decision logic**
- Intended for **technical reviewers, hiring managers, and collaborators**

### What This Project Is Not
- A production-ready system
- A hosted SaaS or turnkey product
- A complete implementation of all pipeline stages
- A benchmark or performance-optimized solution

---

## Future Work

- Config-driven rule layer (`example_config.yaml`)
- Improved deduplication and ranking heuristics
- Additional output formats (HTML / PDF)
- Optional scheduling and feedback loop for continuous refinement
