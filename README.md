Demo repository showcasing the architecture and outputs of an AI-driven trend monitoring system for financial services.


# AI Trend Monitoring

**AI-driven trend monitoring system for financial services.**  
Automatically collects, analyzes, and summarizes high-impact payments and regulatory developments into executive-ready digests.

---

## Overview

AI Trend Monitoring is a modular pipeline designed to support management consultants and financial services leaders with timely, high-signal industry insights.

The system ingests content from selected sources, applies LLM-based analysis, and produces concise trend digests suitable for client briefings and decision-making.

This repository focuses on **architecture, structure, and outputs**, rather than production deployment.

---

## Example Output

A sample executive digest generated by the system:

- [`examples/sample-digest-v1.md`](examples/sample-digest-v1.md)

This illustrates the expected structure, tone, and level of abstraction of the output.

---

## Capabilities

- Collect content from predefined industry sources
- Deduplicate overlapping items
- Classify trends by category (Payments / Regulatory)
- Assess impact level (High / Medium / Low)
- Generate executive-friendly summaries and “Why it matters” insights
- Output structured Markdown digests

---

## How It Works (High Level)

The system follows a clear, modular pipeline:
collect → dedupe → extract → digest → output

- **Collect**: Fetch raw content from selected sources  
- **Dedupe**: Remove duplicates and near-duplicates  
- **Extract**: Use LLMs to extract structured trend data  
- **Digest**: Group, prioritize, and format insights  
- **Output**: Produce a Markdown digest (email-ready)

## Repository Structure

- `examples/`: Sample outputs generated by the system (e.g. executive trend digests).
- `docs/`: High-level documentation describing architecture and pipeline flow.
- `src/`: Skeleton code illustrating the core pipeline stages.
- `templates/`: Reusable templates for digests and configuration examples.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage documentation.

## What This Project Is / Is Not

**This project is:**
- A **portfolio-grade demonstration** of AI-native system design
- Focused on **clarity, structure, and reasoning**
- Intended for **technical reviewers, hiring managers, and collaborators**

**This project is not:**
- A production-ready system
- A hosted SaaS or turnkey product
- A complete implementation of all pipeline stages

---

## Future Work

- Rule-based prioritization layer (pre-LLM filtering)
- Config-driven source and scoring definitions
- Additional output formats (PDF / HTML)
- Dashboard or visualization layer
