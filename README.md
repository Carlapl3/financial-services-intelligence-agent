# AI Trend Monitoring

> Demo repository showcasing the architecture and outputs of an AI-assisted, rule-based trend monitoring agent for financial services.

## Demo

- Loom walkthrough (3–4 min): <PASTE_LOOM_LINK_HERE>
- Example output: `examples/sample-digest-v1.md`
- Agent execution trace (v2): examples/v2-agent-execution-trace.md

## Architecture

The diagram illustrates the end-to-end flow from source ingestion to executive-ready email delivery,
including agent orchestration, guardrails, and long-term memory.

## Overview

AI Trend Monitoring is a task-oriented, AI-assisted agent designed for recurring monitoring of financial and regulatory developments.

The agent collects signals from selected sources, applies configurable rules and prioritization logic, uses LLMs for structured extraction and interpretation, and produces concise, executive-ready digests.

This repository is intentionally scoped as a **portfolio-grade demonstration** of agent design, system architecture, and reasoning — not as a production system.

## What this repository demonstrates

- End-to-end design of an agentic monitoring pipeline used in a real consulting context
- Translation of partner-level information needs into concrete system behavior
- Use of feedback loops and prioritization logic, not just one-off outputs
- Incremental evolution of a system (v1 → v3) with clear architectural boundaries
---
## Typical Use Case

Used by management consulting partners and advisory teams within financial services to:

- Monitor regulatory and market developments
- Identify high-impact signals early
- Produce structured, client-ready briefings for executives

---

## Capabilities

Scalable architecture: Environment-driven model configuration enables controlled model upgrades and clear cost transparency.

- Source-based signal collection
- Rule-based filtering and prioritization
- LLM-assisted extraction and summarization
- Impact classification (e.g. high / medium)
- Generation of executive-ready Markdown digests

## How It Works (High Level)
collect → dedupe → apply_rules → extract → digest → output
1. **Collect** signals from predefined sources  
2. **Dedupe** overlapping or repeated items  
3. **Apply rules** to filter and prioritize signals  
4. **Extract** structured insights using LLMs  
5. **Digest** content into a concise executive format  
6. **Output** as Markdown (email-ready)

---

## Scope
This system is designed for financial services monitoring with configurable sources.
Demo uses public fintech/regulatory sources for illustration.

## Repository Structure

- `examples/`: Sample outputs generated by the agent (e.g. executive trend digests).
- `docs/`: High-level documentation describing architecture, design decisions, and pipeline flow.
- `templates/`: Reusable templates for digests and configuration examples.
- `src/`: Reference implementation of core pipeline stages (sanitized, NDA-safe).
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage documentation.
